# terraform-aws-yugabyte
A Terraform module to deploy and run YugabyteDB on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

## Configuration

* To download and install Terraform, follow the steps given [here](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).

* Export the required credentials in current shell,
  ```sh
  export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE"
  export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="wJal/â€¦/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY"
  ```

  For other authentication methods, take a look at the [AWS
  Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#authentication)
  documentation.

* Create a new directory along with a terraform file,
  ```sh
  $ mkdir yugabytedb-deploy && cd yugabytedb-deploy
  $ touch deploy.tf
  ```

* Open `deploy.tf` in your favorite editor and add following content
  to it,
  ```hcl
  module "yugabyte-db-cluster" {
	# The source module used for creating clusters on AWS.
	source = "github.com/yugabyte/terraform-aws-yugabyte"

	# The name of the cluster to be created.
	cluster_name = "yb-test"

	# Specify an existing AWS key pair
	# Both the name and the path to the corresponding private key file
	ssh_keypair = "SSH_KEYPAIR_NAME"
	ssh_private_key = "PATH_TO_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE"

        # The default configuration is to create an instance with public ip and make it accessible to anyone. This can be overridden by reconfiguring the two properties mentioned below
        use_public_ip_for_ssh = "true"
        associate_public_ip_address = "true"


	# Specify Instance Configuration
        instance_type = "AWS_INSTANCE_CLASS"

	# The existing vpc and subnet ids where the nodes should be spawned.
	region_name = "AWS REGION"
	vpc_id = "VPC_ID_HERE"

	# Cluster data and metadata will be placed in separate AZs to ensure availability during single AZ failure if 3 AZs are specified.
	# To tolerate single AZ failure, the AZ count should be equal to RF.
	availability_zones = ["AZ1", "AZ2", "AZ3"]
	subnet_ids = ["SUBNET_AZ1", SUBNET_AZ2", "SUBNET_AZ3"]

	# Replication factor.
	replication_factor = "3"

	# The number of nodes in the cluster, this cannot be lower than the replication factor.
	num_instances = "3"
  }

  output "outputs" {
	value = module.yugabyte-db-cluster
  }
  ```

## Usage

Initialize Terraform first if you have not already done so.

```
$ terraform init
```

To check what changes are going to happen in the environment run the following,

```
$ terraform plan
```

Now run the following to create the instances and bring up the cluster.

```
$ terraform apply
```

Once the cluster is created, you can go to the URL `http://<node ip or dns name>:7000` to view the YB-Master UI. You can find the node's IP address or DNS by running the following:

```
$ terraform state show module.yugabyte-db-cluster.aws_instance.yugabyte_nodes[0]
```

You can access the YB-Master UI by going to public IP address of any of the instances at port `7000`. The IP address can be viewed by replacing `0` from above command with desired index.

You can check the state of the nodes at any point by running the following command.

```
$ terraform show
```

To destroy what we just created, you can run the following command.

```
$ terraform destroy
```
`Note:- To make any changes in the created cluster you will need the terraform state files. So don't delete state files of Terraform.`

## Test 

### Configurations

#### Prerequisites

- [Terraform **(~> 0.12.5)**](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
- [Golang **(~> 1.12.10)**](https://golang.org/dl/)

#### Environment setup

* Sign Up for AWS.

* Configure your AWS credentials using one of the supported methods for AWS CLI tools, such as setting the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and 
  `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables.

* Set the following environment variables.
  ```sh
  export SUBNET_IDS="<SUBNET-1>,<SUBNET-2>"
  export AVAILABILITY_ZONES="<AZ-ZONE-1>,<AZ-ZONE-2>"
  export VPC_ID=<VPC-ID>
  export AWS_REGION=<AWS-REGION>
  export GITHUB_RUN_ID=<RANDOM-ID>
  export ALLOWED_SOURCES="0.0.0.0/0,<PUBLIC-IP>/32,SG-ID"
  ```

* Change your working directory to the `test` folder.

#### Run test

Then simply run it in the local shell:

```sh
$ go test -v -timeout 20m  yugabyte_test.go
```
* Note that go has a default test timeout of 10 minutes. With infrastructure testing, your tests will surpass the 10 minutes very easily. To extend the timeout, you can pass in the -timeout option, which takes a go duration string (e.g 10m for 10 minutes or 1h for 1 hour). In the above command, we use the -timeout option to override to a 90 minute timeout.
* When you hit the timeout, Go automatically exits the test, skipping all cleanup routines. This is problematic for infrastructure testing because it will skip your deferred infrastructure cleanup steps (i.e terraform destroy), leaving behind the infrastructure that was spun up. So it is important to use a longer timeout every time you run the tests.
